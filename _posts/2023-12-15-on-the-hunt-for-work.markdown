It can be hard to figure out what to do a complicated world. What are your skills? What are your passions, priorities, and perspectives? What motivates you to learn more and be at your best? I've been thinking about these questions, and grappling with the practical fact that I need to be paid to do something. Sometimes, I get frustrated that I need to find a way to work for money, but most of the time I respect the way things are and try to think about my place in a world dependent on so many causes and effects over so long a time. I plan to finish my PhD in 2024 and I am looking for new opportunities to survive make the world a better place to live.
