After months of active job searching, I can excitedly report that I have begun a new position
as a postdoctoral research fellow in the Psychology Department at Swarthmore College. One of 
my roles is to help coordinate EEG studies. We have 3 separate EEG testing rooms, each with their 
own control room, in one large suite with a sink, fancy water, and plenty of storage space. 
We use EGI/MagStim high-impedance caps and soon we'll also set up some Brain Vision
equipment. As I learn how to conduct research here, I have made progress with the ongoing work.
The main publication for my first-year project at Tufts was just resubmitted as a major revision
to PLOS ONE. You can see everything [here](https://osf.io/mcbgn/). My dissertation will soon be on 
ProQuest, and the updated document can be found [here] (https://osf.io/js5bh).
