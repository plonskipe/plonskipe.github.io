I recently completed a Ph.D. in Psychology and Cognitive Science at Tufts University, in the Emotion, Brain, and Behavior Lab. I studied emotion – how emotions occur in the mind and body, how people regulate their emotions, and the impacts of affective processes on individual and collective problems.  
  
My main line of research explores how people experience and regulate emotions when faced with climate change information, and how those emotion processes are associated with climate change solutions. I developed a conceptual framework and conducted three empirical studies in this area as a graduate student at Tufts.  
  
As a graduate student, I also studied spatial perforamce (route planning) under time pressure. This research was part of a collaboration with the Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Science on emotion regulation and performance in stressful situations.  
  
A third area of interest is behavioral health. I have worked on behavioral health research at the Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University, including the Institute for Drug and Alcohol Studies, Clark-Hill Institute for Positive Youth Development, and the (now-defunct) Commonwealth Institute on Child and Family Studies.  
  
I completed a M.A. in Psychological Sciences at Northern Arizona University, where I studied Satipaṭṭhāna-style mindfulness from a psychophysiological perspective, and a B.S. in Psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University, where I studied dispositional mindfulness.  

I think open science practices and transparency are important.  
  
I have transferable skills in mentorship, training, and leading small teams, programming, managing, and analyzing data (preference for R and Python), and communicating scientific information. I also have experience teaching, with a focus on research methods and statistics.
