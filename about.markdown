I recently completed my PhD in Psychology and Cognitive Science at Tufts University with Heather L. Urry. In Heather's Emotion, Brain, and Behavior Lab, I studied emotion – how emotions occur in the mind and body, how people regulate their emotions, and the impacts of affective processes on individual and collective problems. I think open science practices and transparency are important. I have transferable skills in mentorship, training, and leading small teams, programming, managing, and analyzing data (R and Python), and communicating scientific information.

My primary line of research explores how people experience and regulate emotions when faced with climate change information, and how those emotion processes are associated with climate change solutions. I developed a conceptual framework and conducted three empirical studies in this area as a graduate student at Tufts.
I also developed a line of work on emotion and performance in stressful contexts, specifically focusing on spatial performance under conditions of time pressure, in collaboration with the Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Science at Tufts. A third area of research involves behavioral health outcomes, previously conducted at the Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Institute for Drug and Alcohol Studies at VCU, Clark-Hill Institute for Positive Youth Development at VCU, and the (defunct) Center for Child and Family Studies at VCU. My MA is in Psychological Sciences from Northern Arizona University, where I studied Satipaṭṭhāna-style mindfulness from a social psychological perspective. My BS is in Psychology from Virginia Commonwealth University, where I studied dispositional mindfulness.
