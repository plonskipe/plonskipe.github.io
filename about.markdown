I recently completed a Ph.D. in Psychology and Cognitive Science at Tufts University, in the Emotion, Brain, and Behavior Lab. I studied emotion – how emotions occur in the mind and body, how people regulate their emotions, and the impacts of affective processes on individual and collective problems.  
  
I think open science practices and transparency are important.  
  
I have transferable skills in mentorship, training, and leading small teams, programming, managing, and analyzing data (preference for R and Python), and communicating scientific information.  

I have experience teaching as a lab instructor, with a focus on research methods and statistics.  
  
**Research**  
  
I study affective information processing, with a focus on mindfulness and emotion regulation. I am interested in psychophysiological processes, subjective experience, and behavior. I aim to build knowledge that will help to address collective problems, improve health, and optimize performance. One way to visualize my psychological framework is:

My main line of research explores how people experience and regulate emotions when faced with climate change information, and how those emotion processes are associated with climate change solutions. I developed a conceptual framework and conducted three empirical studies in this area as a graduate student at Tufts. ([dissertation link](https://osf.io/semy7/?view_only=){:target="_blank"})

*In the above Figure, the solid lines correspond to proposed paths in the conceptual framework. Climate emotions are initiated by exposure to climate change information (which can be external or internal).*

I also studied spatial perforamce (route planning) under time pressure ([route planning project link](https://osf.io/mcbgn/){:target="_blank"}). This research on emotion regulation and performance in stressful situations was part of a collaboration with the Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Science.

*The leftmost plotted condition was hypothesized to have the lowest time pressure and the rightmost, the highest. The panels indicate the total time condition, the x-axis the waiting time condition, and the paired plots indicate the urgency condition (red = urgent). In each condition, horizontal lines indicate quartiles. Each dot is the mean for that condition. The overlayed horizontal line is the grand mean across all conditions.*

A third area of interest is behavioral health. I worked on behavioral health research at the Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University, including the Institute for Drug and Alcohol Studies, Clark-Hill Institute for Positive Youth Development, and the (now-defunct) Commonwealth Institute on Child and Family Studies.  
  
I completed a M.A. in Psychological Sciences at Northern Arizona University, where I studied Satipaṭṭhāna-style mindfulness meditation training from a psychophysiological perspective. I completed a B.S. in Psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University and worked on studies of dispositional mindfulness and mindfulness interventions.
